# Spyne.ai-SDE-Intern-Assessment
It is a internship assignment
For the Car Management Application assignment, here’s how you can approach the development and build the necessary code and descriptions for each part.

1. Tech Stack
Here’s a recommended tech stack for the project:

Frontend: React (or any other frontend framework you're comfortable with)
Backend: Node.js with Express.js
Database: MongoDB (as it’s well-suited for handling unstructured data like images and tags)
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication
Cloud Deployment: Vercel (for frontend), Heroku (for backend)
2. Backend Implementation
Setting up Express Server:
To create a backend service using Node.js and Express, follow these steps:

Initialize a Node.js project:
Create an index.js file for your backend:
User Model (MongoDB Schema)
For user authentication, create a user schema (models/User.js):

Car Model (MongoDB Schema)
For storing cars' data (models/Car.js):
API Routes
Now, create the routes for the CRUD operations and authentication.

Create User (Sign Up)
Login User (Sign In)
Create Car (Add Car)
Get Cars (List Cars)
Get Car Details
Update Car
Delete Car
Authentication Middleware
To ensure users can only manage their cars, you need a middleware to authenticate the user using JWT.
3. Frontend Implementation (React)
Setting up React Project
You can create a new React project by running:
Sign Up / Login Pages
Create simple forms to handle user registration and login:

SignUp Component:
Login Component:
